    "description": "<p>This example shows off many things: for loops, variable assignments and function calls incl. the passing of parameters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Notice the nifty lowercase <code>aview()</code> function, which takes long strings and <strong>breaks them up for you</strong>, making it easier to create messages in the alpha register. You can also&nbsp;build up long message strings by&nbsp;<strong>referring to variable names</strong>&nbsp;mixed in with descriptive text. e.g.</p>\r\n<pre class=\"language-python\"><code>aview('Counter ', i, ' result= ', total)</code></pre>\r\n<p>Time saver!</p>\r\n<p>P.S. The only difference between alpha() and aview() is that aview() adds an AVIEW to the RPN.&nbsp; Also <code>print()</code> is a synonym for aview(), and would be familiar to Python programmers.</p>",
