    "description": "<p>Flags are not used in Python programming - instead, any Python variable can be used to hold a boolean. However if you need to test, set or clear various HP42S flags then use these functions: <code>CF</code>, <code>SF</code>,&nbsp;FS? use <code>isFS&nbsp;</code>and for FC? use <code>isFC</code>.&nbsp; Note these all take the flag number as a parameter.</p>\r\n<p>This example tests if system flag 21 (controls print on/off from within a HP42S/Free42 program) is set.</p>\r\n<p>Note that the HP42S commands&nbsp;<code>FS?, FC?, FC?C and&nbsp;FS?C</code> are not supported because they are flow of control altering commands - not relevant&nbsp;in Python programming.&nbsp; Those commands are not even legal Python syntax (no question marks allowed).</p>",
