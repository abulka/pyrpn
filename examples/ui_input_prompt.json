    "description": "<p>You need to specify native uppercase HP42S commands in your Python code for doing user input.&nbsp; The basic difference between HP42S native PROMPT and INPUT is that the former specifies a custom text prompt, whilst the latter prompts with the name of the variable, and shows the current value of that variable.&nbsp; Both commands stop program execution till you press R/S on the calculator.</p>\r\n<p>Interestingly, I have observed that if you do a&nbsp;AVIEW(\"some message\") prior to an INPUT, you get the message on the top line of the HP42S and the input prompt on the second line - nice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Warning</span>: If you are viewing a message using AVIEW(\"some really long multi-line message\") that takes up <strong>two lines</strong>, then you won't see the subsequent prompt generated by INPUT.&nbsp; This is because the prompt&nbsp; on the second line of the HP42S display is occupied by the multiline alpha string and the INPUT command doesn't seem to clear it.&nbsp; To work around this edge case of Free42/HP42S? behaviour view an empty string in the alpha register using print(\"\").&nbsp; Clearing the alpha register with CLA() is not enough.</p>\r\n<p>There is <a href=\"http://www.hpmuseum.org/forum/thread-11655-post-106442.html#pid106442\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a proposal</a> for this Python to RPN converter to support the native Python input() command (see below section entitled <em>Future work on Input</em>) but this is not yet supported.</p>\r\n<h4>INPUT</h4>\r\n<p>Takes a normal Python variable as a parameter - do not put variable in quotes. Specifying HP42S registers not supported.</p>\r\n<p>Note: The variable referred to as the parameter will be converted into RPN as a named variable rather than converted into an auto allocated numbered RPN register - unless that variable has previously been assigned to - in which case it will be converted into RPN as an auto allocated numbered register.</p>\r\n<h4>PROMPT</h4>\r\n<p>Display the Alpha register and halt program execution. To store the value entered during the prompt into a variable simply assign to that variable e.g. myvar = PROMPT('enter val').&nbsp; Remember that you must type a numeric value, then when ready, hit R/S on your calculator to continue running the program after a prompt.</p>\r\n<h4><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">Advanced: How Python variables are converted to either RPN named variables vs RPN registers</span></h4>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">You don't have to worry about this advanced topic, because when you are programming in Python, you don't really care how your Python variables are converted to RPN.&nbsp; You just basicaly think in Python and treat the generated RPN as \"machine code\" that you never look at.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;\">However, for those interested, read the \"RPN tips\" in the example code for information on what RPN code is generated.&nbsp; You might be interested in this if you want your Python program to end up with some RPN named variables for use and access later.</span></p>",
