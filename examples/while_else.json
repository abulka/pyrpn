If you break out of the loop, or if an exception is raised, it won't be executed.</p>\r\n<p>The else clause is executed if you exit a block normally, by hitting the loop condition or falling off the bottom of a try block. It is not executed if you break or return out of a block, or raise an exception. It works for not only while and for loops, but also try blocks.</p>",
